;; Strategies to Test

;; Three day majority for NATGAS:
;; Start with t - 3 days. Determine the direction of that day. If the next two
;; days have new maxima in the same direction, that's the easy case: either
;; continue or start a new trade in that direction.
;; If the middle day is down range from the first, but the second is up range
;; from the first, same as above.
;; If the two end days are down range, exit an existing trade.
